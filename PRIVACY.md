Welcome to ULTRA, developed and operated by Serene Interactive, Global (SiG). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use ULTRA. By accessing or using ULTRA, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Introduction

ULTRA is an internal operational tool designed for authorized SiG personnel. This policy outlines our approach to data handling, privacy protection, and international compliance.

## About Serene Interactive, Global

Our company operates globally with presences in Japan, Canada, and expanding across additional international markets.

## Exception-Based Audit Model

**CRITICAL: Our data logging follows an Exception-Based Audit model.**

We do **not** store, log, or retain standard conversational data. All interactions with ULTRA are processed in real-time and are discarded immediately after response generation, with the exception of **Critical Events**.

### What We Log

We only log **Critical Events**, which include:

- **System Failures:** API timeouts, crashes, logic loops, or technical errors
- **Safety Triggers:** Any time ULTRA refuses a prompt due to safety filters
- **User Reports:** Any interaction where a user explicitly mentions a "bug" or "error"

These logs are maintained solely for:
- Compliance with regulatory requirements
- Security monitoring and incident response
- Technical troubleshooting and system improvement
- Audit requirements from SiG leadership

### What We Do NOT Log

We do **not** log:
- Standard conversational data
- Prompts or queries (unless they trigger a Critical Event)
- Responses generated by ULTRA
- System status or operational information (unless it constitutes a System Failure)

### Transparency Disclosure (EU Compliance)

**For users in the European Economic Area, this notice applies:**

> ULTRA is an agentic AI assistant. To ensure system integrity, critical errors and safety exceptions are logged for human review. For support, contact support@sereneinteractive.com.

This disclosure appears in ULTRA's #info channel or command output in EU-accessible environments to ensure transparency as required by the EU AI Act.
